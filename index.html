            <h1>Why a strong password is important and how to pick one</h1>
            <p>Strong passwords are incredibly important today for a variety of reasons. A strong password acts as a barrier against individuals from gaining access to your information. It makes it harder for malicious actors or hackers to get your password or your accounts or your systems. They do a good job at safeguarding against financial losses, theft, identity fraud, etcetera. Many industries have compliance requirements that mandate passwords in order to protect user data. Failure to adhere to these regulations and compliance requirements could potentially result in an array of harsh repercussions and expensive penalties. Weak passwords are easy targets for nasty cyber criminals who are looking to take over unsuspecting users accounts for various malignant activities, which includes sending spam, accessing information that is confidential, and spreading malware which can harm your computer. Accounts that have been compromised can possibly lead to severe reputational damage for organizations or companies or individuals who have been tasked with certain obligations. Passwords which have good strength can possibly help to maintain a level of trust with customers or clients or stakeholders by displaying a commitment to security. It can prevent credential stuffing attacks. Cyber criminals, in many cases, use stolen credentials and try to access other accounts that those credentials have access to. This technique is called credential stuffing and it is highly damaging to many companies. A unique password that is also very strong is effective at protecting componies from these types of horrifying attacks. By strengthening a password, the overall system becomes more resilient and minimizes the potential damages of data compromises and security breaches. Passwords that are very strong with sufficient amounts of complexity and are also incredibly long make it almost impossible for attackers to guess through using millions of combinations systematically. If companies emphasize how important it is to get a password that is strong, they will encourage better cybersecurity practices among its workers. On a multiuser system, a strong password can reduce the risk of identity theft. If an identity thief compromises an account on a multiuser system, it could damage the reputation of the individual. Poor password security could lead to hackers stealing and leaking your private communications, documents, financial information, or genitalia. I have a friend whose rear-end got leaked online and he ended up, as a man, on depression medication to this day. 
	Before we learn how to pick a password, it is important to know that you should update your passwords frequently. Updating your passwords regularly demonstrates high security standards and will help protect against evolving cyber threats. This can, in many cases, ensure resilience against potential attacks. There are three types of accounts: high-security accounts, moderate-security accounts, and low-security accounts. You should get a journal and write out all of your accounts. Then, you need to label them as high or medium or low security accounts. Once you have done this, you should update the password for the high-security accounts on a daily or hourly basis. The medium-security accounts should be updated monthly and the low-security accounts on a yearly basis. This will ensure adequate protection from most threats in the cybersphere. Picking the password is easy. You should ensure that your password is at least 12 characters long. The more characters there are, the stronger the password security of your account is. Use a mix of numbers, special characters, lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and any other type of character available to aim for something unguessable. Try to be unpredictable and do not use words that are common. Also, do not use your birthday or easily guessable passwords. You can enable other keyboards on your device so you can use characters in other languages. These other languages include: Russian, Ukrainian, Bulgarian, Serbian, Belarusian, Greek, Arabic, Persian (Farsi), Urdu, Hebrew, Mandarin Chinese, Japanese (Hiragana, Katakana, Kanji), Korean (Hangul), Hindi, Bengali, Tamil, Telugu, Thai, Vietnamese, Macedonian, Tajik, Georgian (Mkhedruli script), Armenian (Armenian script).
